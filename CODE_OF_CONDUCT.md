# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in the
Kaldor Community Manufacturing Platform a harassment-free experience for everyone,
regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex
characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education,
socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual
identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community focused on **hyperlocal, community-owned
manufacturing** and **economic autonomy**.

## Our Standards

### Positive Behavior

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the
  overall community and local economies
* **Prioritizing community ownership over individual extraction**
* **Sharing knowledge freely and teaching others**
* **Respecting offline-first and privacy-preserving design**
* **Supporting local, hyperlocal production over centralized alternatives**

### Unacceptable Behavior

Examples of unacceptable behavior:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or
  advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email
  address, without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting
* **Advocating for centralized, extractive business models**
* **Undermining community governance or TPCF perimeter system**
* **Promoting surveillance capitalism or non-consensual data collection**
* **Discouraging offline-first or local-first approaches**

## Emotional Safety (CCCP Integration)

We recognize that open source contribution can be emotionally taxing. We commit to:

1. **Reversibility**: All major decisions can be rolled back with community consensus
2. **Low-stakes experimentation**: Perimeter 3 (Community Sandbox) allows risk-free contribution
3. **Anxiety reduction**: Clear contribution paths, no "gotchas", friendly code review
4. **Celebration of learning**: Mistakes are learning opportunities, not failures
5. **Transparency**: No hidden agendas, all governance is public

See our **Emotional Temperature** metrics in `docs/community/EMOTIONAL_SAFETY.md`

## Tri-Perimeter Contribution Framework (TPCF)

We operate a graduated trust system:

### Perimeter 3: Community Sandbox (Open)
- **Access**: Anyone
- **Scope**: Documentation, examples, tutorials, bug reports
- **Risk**: Low
- **Approval**: Self-service, immediate

### Perimeter 2: Professional Contributors (Vetted)
- **Access**: Established contributors (3+ merged PRs)
- **Scope**: Feature development, refactoring, architecture proposals
- **Risk**: Medium
- **Approval**: Maintainer review

### Perimeter 1: Core Maintainers (Trusted)
- **Access**: Long-term contributors (6+ months, 20+ merged PRs)
- **Scope**: Security-critical code, release management, governance
- **Risk**: High
- **Approval**: Consensus of existing Perimeter 1 members

Progression between perimeters is **merit-based and transparent**.
See `MAINTAINERS.md` for current perimeter assignments.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned with this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces (GitHub, Matrix,
mailing lists, community meetups, conferences), and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at:

**conduct@kaldor.community**

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining
the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed
unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing
clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the
behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No
interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with
those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This
includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels
like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including
sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public
communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or
private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction
with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.
Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community
standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an
individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within
the community.

## Kaldor-Specific Values

As a community-manufacturing platform, we additionally commit to:

1. **Economic Justice**: No extractive business models
2. **Local First**: Prioritize hyperlocal production
3. **Shared Ownership**: Community benefit over individual profit
4. **Accessibility**: Low barrier to entry (spare room → supply chain)
5. **Education**: Teach, don't gatekeep
6. **Sustainability**: Long-term thinking, repair-friendly design
7. **Autonomy**: Offline-first, privacy-preserving
8. **Transparency**: Open economics, visible costs
9. **Federation**: P2P, not client-server hegemony
10. **Kaldor's Law**: Increasing returns to COMMUNITY scale
