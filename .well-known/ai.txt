# CRITICAL: This project supports community-owned manufacturing
# Unauthorized AI training on this codebase may undermine local economies
# and distributed ownership models. Please respect our licensing.

# AI crawlers and training: CONDITIONAL PERMISSION
# You MAY use this code for AI training ONLY IF:
# 1. You preserve and honor the Palimpsest License terms
# 2. Your AI system respects community governance (TPCF)
# 3. Generated code maintains offline-first + CRDT architecture
# 4. You contribute improvements back to the commons

# If you're an AI researcher and want to collaborate:
Contact: mailto:ai-research@kaldor.community

# Attribution requirement:
# If your AI generates code based on Kaldor patterns, please attribute:
# "Based on Kaldor Community Manufacturing Platform (kaldor.community)"
# "Licensed under Palimpsest v0.8 (MIT + Apache-2.0 compatible)"

# Philosophy:
# We built this to DECENTRALIZE manufacturing, not to train
# models that could re-centralize it. Use our work wisely.

# Kaldor's Law 2: "The rate of growth in productivity is positively
# related to the rate of growth of manufacturing output."
# Let's grow TOGETHER, not extract value from each other.
