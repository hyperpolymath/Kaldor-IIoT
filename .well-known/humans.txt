/* PROJECT VALUES */

1. Offline-First: Works without internet, respects autonomy
2. Community Ownership: TPCF graduated trust model
3. Hyperlocal: Spare room → supply chain
4. Type Safety: ReScript + Rust + Deno strict
5. Memory Safety: Zero unsafe blocks
6. Reproducible: Nix flake, deterministic builds
7. Accessible: WCAG 2.1 AA, screen reader tested
8. Sustainable: Repair-friendly, long-term support
9. Transparent: Open economics, visible costs
10. Federated: P2P mesh, not client-server

/* KALDOR'S LAW 2 */

"The rate of growth in productivity is positively related
to the rate of growth of manufacturing output."

By decentralizing manufacturing to spare rooms, we create
increasing returns to scale at the COMMUNITY level, not
the corporate level.
