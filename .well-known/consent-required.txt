# DATA PROCESSING CONSENT

## Kaldor IIoT Community Manufacturing Platform

**Last Updated**: 2025-11-28

**Contact**: privacy@kaldor.community

### Consent Requirements

Kaldor IIoT processes minimal data following "Necessary Processing Only" principles (Ada philosophy).

We require explicit consent for:

1. **Device Telemetry**: Sensor readings from ESP32-C6 devices (temperature, vibration, production metrics)
   - **Purpose**: Equipment monitoring, predictive maintenance, production analytics
   - **Retention**: 90 days in TimescaleDB (then aggregated/anonymized)
   - **Legal Basis**: Legitimate interest (equipment operation) + consent for analytics

2. **Governance Participation**: Voice credit allocation, voting history
   - **Purpose**: Quadratic voting, CURP consensus protocol
   - **Retention**: Permanent (immutable governance log)
   - **Legal Basis**: Consent (voluntary participation in governance)

3. **Usage Analytics**: Anonymized dashboard interactions
   - **Purpose**: Improving user experience, identifying bugs
   - **Retention**: 30 days (then deleted)
   - **Legal Basis**: Consent (opt-in only, disabled by default)

### Data We Do NOT Collect

❌ No tracking cookies
❌ No third-party analytics (Google Analytics, Facebook Pixel, etc.)
❌ No advertising identifiers
❌ No location tracking (except coarse geographic cluster for network coordination)
❌ No social graph / contact scraping
❌ No behavioral profiling

### Your Rights (GDPR, CCPA)

- **Right to Access**: Download all your data via dashboard
- **Right to Erasure**: Delete your account and all associated data (except immutable governance logs, which are pseudonymized)
- **Right to Portability**: Export data in JSON format
- **Right to Object**: Opt out of analytics (default: opted out)
- **Right to Rectification**: Update incorrect data via dashboard

**Exercise Rights**: privacy@kaldor.community

### CRDT & Offline-First Implications

Kaldor uses CRDTs (Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types) for offline-first functionality. This means:

- Data is replicated across nodes in your local network
- Deletions propagate eventually (may take hours if nodes offline)
- Governance votes are immutable once committed (blockchain-like)

**Consent Withdrawal**: We honor deletion requests but cannot retroactively alter distributed CRDT state. Pseudonymization applied instead.

### Data Controllers & Processors

- **Controller**: Your local Kaldor community node (self-hosted)
- **Processor**: Kaldor IIoT project (provides software only, does not host data)
- **Subprocessors**: None (no third-party data processors)

### Cross-Border Data Transfers

Data stays within your local network (offline-first). No cross-border transfers unless:

1. You explicitly sync with other geographic clusters
2. You use cloud backup (optional, self-configured)

### Children's Privacy (COPPA, GDPR)

Kaldor IIoT is not directed at children under 13 (COPPA) or 16 (GDPR).

If minors participate in community workshops, parental consent required.

### Automated Decision-Making

❌ No automated decisions with legal/significant effects
✅ Pattern generation (WASM) and job scheduling are purely operational (no profiling)

### Cookies

We use ONE essential cookie for authentication (session token).

No tracking cookies. No advertising cookies.

**Cookie Policy**: See SECURITY.md

### Changes to Consent Requirements

We'll notify you 30 days before material changes to data processing.

**Notification Method**: Email to account address + dashboard banner
