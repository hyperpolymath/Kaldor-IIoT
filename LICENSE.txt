## Palimpsest Addendum

This license incorporates the **Palimpsest License v0.8** principles:

### 1. Community Ownership

All contributions remain owned by their authors but are licensed to the
community under the terms above. No contributor license agreement (CLA)
or copyright assignment is required.

### 2. Graduated Trust (TPCF)

Contributors advance through perimeters based on merit:
- **Perimeter 3** (Community Sandbox): Open to all
- **Perimeter 2** (Professional Contributors): Earned through contribution
- **Perimeter 1** (Core Maintainers): Consensus-based advancement

See MAINTAINERS.md for details.

### 3. Reversibility

Major decisions can be reversed through community consensus. We value
experimentation and acknowledge that mistakes happen.

### 4. Emotional Safety

We commit to low-stakes contribution, clear expectations, and anxiety
reduction. See CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md for our Emotional Temperature principles.

### 5. Offline-First Philosophy

This software prioritizes local autonomy over cloud dependency. All core
functionality works without internet access.

### 6. Anti-Centralization

This software is designed to decentralize manufacturing, not to create new
points of centralized control. Use it to empower communities, not extract
value from them.

### 7. Kaldor's Law Integration

We measure success by productivity growth through manufacturing output growth,
at the COMMUNITY level, not the corporate level.

"The rate of growth in productivity is positively related to the rate of
growth of manufacturing output." - Nicholas Kaldor
